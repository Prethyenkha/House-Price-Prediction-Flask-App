# 🏠 Elastic Net House Price Prediction

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction Web App**!  
This project leverages advanced machine learning—**Elastic Net Regression**—and a modern web interface to predict California house prices using features like *income, house age, number of rooms, bedrooms, and population*.

---

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository or download the project folder:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prethyenkha/House-Price-Prediction-Flask-App.git
   cd House-Price-Prediction-Flask-App/ElasticNetApp
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## 📦 Dependencies

- `Flask` - web framework
- `scikit-learn` - Elastic Net Regression
- `joblib` - Model serialization
- `numpy`, `pandas` - Data handling
- See `requirements.txt` for details

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Model Training:**  
   The Elastic Net Regression model is trained (see `model.ipynb`) with California housing data and saved using `joblib`.

2. **Web Interface:**  
   Users input house features via the simple UI.

3. **Prediction:**  
   The Flask app loads the trained model and predicts the house price instantly.
